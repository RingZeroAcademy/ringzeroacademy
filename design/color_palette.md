# Color Usage Guide

## Color Palette

```css
Ink Black: #0b1622
Charcoal Blue: #45525f
Cyan: #00ffff
```

## The 60-30-10 Rule Application

The website will use the 60-30-10 rule to create visual balance. Ink Black covers 60% of the design, Charcoal Blue covers 30%, and Cyan covers 10%.

## Ink Black (#0b1622) - 60% Dominant Color

Use Ink Black for large areas and backgrounds. This color creates the foundation of your dark mode design.

**Where to use Ink Black:**

- Main page background
- Header background
- Footer background
- Modal and popup backgrounds
- Dropdown menu backgrounds
- Main content area background

**Why this works:** The subtle blue tint in Ink Black reduces eye strain compared to pure black. It creates a professional, modern appearance suitable for tutorial content.

## Charcoal Blue (#45525f) - 30% Secondary Color

Use Charcoal Blue for secondary elements and containers. This color provides structure and organization to your content.

**Where to use Charcoal Blue:**

- Navigation bar background
- Sidebar background
- Card backgrounds (for tutorial listings, code examples, tip boxes)
- Section dividers and borders
- Table headers
- Input field backgrounds
- Secondary button backgrounds
- Code block backgrounds
- Comment sections
- Breadcrumb backgrounds

**Why this works:** Charcoal Blue creates clear separation between different content sections. It provides enough contrast against Ink Black to define areas without being harsh on the eyes.

## Cyan (#00ffff) - 10% Accent Color

Use Cyan sparingly for elements that need attention. This bright color guides users to important actions and information.

**Where to use Cyan:**

- Primary call-to-action buttons (such as "Start Tutorial", "Next Lesson", "Download")
- Active navigation links
- Hyperlinks in text
- Hover states on interactive elements
- Current page indicator in navigation
- Icons (sparingly)
- Progress indicators and completion badges
- Section headings (use with restraint)
- Focus borders on form inputs
- Loading indicators
- Important notifications
- Highlighting active code lines in examples

**Why this works:** The bright Cyan draws the eye immediately. Using it only for important elements ensures users know where to click and what to read next.

## Text Colors

Proper text colors ensure readability and accessibility.

**Primary Text (Main Content):**
- Use white (#ffffff) or very light gray (#e4e4e4) on Ink Black backgrounds
- Use white (#ffffff) on Charcoal Blue backgrounds
- Maintain minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio

**Secondary Text (Less Important Information):**
- Use light gray (#a0a0a0 or #b0b0b0) on Ink Black backgrounds
- Use for timestamps, metadata, captions, and helper text

**Link Text:**
- Use Cyan (#00ffff) for all clickable links
- Add underline on hover for additional clarity
- Never use Cyan for non-clickable text

**Heading Text:**
- Use white (#ffffff) for main headings (H1, H2)
- Consider Cyan for accent headings, but use sparingly
- Ensure headings stand out through size and weight, not just color

## Functional Color States

These colors indicate specific states and feedback to users.

**Success Messages:**
- Use green (#10b981 or similar) for successful actions
- Examples: "Tutorial completed", "Progress saved"

**Error Messages:**
- Use red (#ef4444 or similar) for errors and warnings
- Examples: "Invalid input", "Connection failed"

**Warning Messages:**
- Use orange or yellow (#f59e0b or similar) for caution
- Examples: "This will delete your progress", "Unsaved changes"

**Information Messages:**
- Use Cyan (#00ffff) for helpful information
- Examples: "Pro tip:", "Did you know?"

## Important Guidelines

**Do:**
- Use Cyan for all primary actions and important interactive elements
- Maintain consistent color usage throughout the website
- Test all color combinations for sufficient contrast
- Use white or very light gray for main text content
- Reserve Cyan for elements that require user attention

**Do Not:**
- Use Cyan for large text blocks (it strains the eyes)
- Mix functional colors (do not use red for success or green for errors)
- Use color alone to convey information (add icons or text labels)
- Use too many shades of each color (stick to your defined palette)
- Apply Cyan to more than 10-15% of your design

## Accessibility Reminders

- Always check that text has sufficient contrast against its background
- Do not rely on color alone to indicate interactive elements (use underlines, borders, or icons)
- Provide hover and focus states for all clickable elements
- Test your website with color blindness simulators
- Ensure all important content is readable without color
